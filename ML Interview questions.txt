Hello Everyone,

Good evening.

Here is the Question 3: 

What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?

It will train with unlabeled data.

These algorithms are designed to find structures, hidden patterns, and relationships within the data,
without human intervention.

Unsupervised ML algorithms form the clusters / Groups based on similar characteristics.

Here we do not have any dependent or independent features.

Examples:

Customer Segmentation, News Classification and more

Thank you.

Happy Learning. ðŸ˜Š
